# 3DShapes Library
## What does this library do exactly?
In a nutshell, this library is a toolkit of algorithms to do various calculations of different 3D-shapes.

## How do I use it?
After adding it to your classpath (depending on your IDE), you can reference shapes like so (Cube for example):
```
import Shapes.Cube;
```

Alternatively, you can import all Shapes in the library by doing:
```
import Shapes.*;
```
